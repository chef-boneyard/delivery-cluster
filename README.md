# `delivery-cluster` cookbook
This cookbook installs Chef Delivery, a solution for continuously delivering
applications and infrastructure safely at speed.

Delivery is not open source software and requires a license from Chef to install
and use. This cookbook is open source and released under the Apache 2.0 license,
but the packages it installs are private source and require a license key.

If you happened stumble here on your own you can request an [INVITE](https://www.chef.io/delivery/)
or speak with your account rep.

This cookbook will setup a full delivery cluster which includes:

*  1 -  Chef Server 12
*  1 -  Delivery Server
*  N -  Build Nodes (Recommend at least 3)
*  1 -  Supermarket Server (Required for cookbook workflow)

Additionally it enables extra optional infrastructure:
*  1 -  Analytics Server (Not Required)
*  1 -  Splunk Server (Not Required)
*  1 -  DR Standby Delivery server (Not Required)

It will install the appropriate platform-specific delivery package
and perform the initial configuration.

Easy Setup
------------

The easiest way to setup a Delivery Cluster is to follow these four steps:

#### 1) Download your Delivery license key
Delivery requires a valid license to activate successfully. **If you do
not have a license key, you can request one from your CHEF account
representative.**

You will need to have the `delivery.license` file present on your provisioner
node or local workstation and specify it on the next step.

#### 2) Install and Configure ChefDK

Follow the instructions at https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html to install and configure chefdk as your default version of ruby.

#### 3) Create an environment

Generate an environment file using the following command

```
$ rake setup:generate_env
```

You can accept the default options by pressing `<enter>`. Note that you must customize the
configuration for Delivery's license file.

Remember to export your environment by running: `export CHEF_ENV=my_environment_name`

If this is a disaster recovery (DR) cluster, see the Disaster Recovery section below in additional
features **_BEFORE_** proceeding to step 4.

#### 4) Provision your Delivery Cluster

```
$ rake setup:cluster
```

#### Access to Delivery Cluster

At this time you should have your Delivery Cluster up & running.

Now it is time to get access. You can use the `admin` credentials shown by:

```
rake info:delivery_creds
```

#### Provision a Supermarket Server

A private Supermarket instance is required to resolve cookbook dependencies. Create one for your environment with the following command:

```
$ rake setup:supermarket
```

Additional features [OPTIONAL]
------------

#### Provision an Analytics Server

Once you have completed the `cluster` provisioning, you could setup an Analytics Server by running:

```
$ rake setup:analytics
```

That will provision and activate Analytics on your entire cluster.

#### Provision a Splunk Server

Would you like to try our Splunk Server Integration with Analytics? If yes, provision the server by running:

```
$ rake setup:splunk
```

Disaster Recovery
-----------------

To setup disaster recovery, you'll need to edit `environments/<clust-name>.json` and
add the `disaster_recovery` block to the `delivery` property:

    * If you are using the aws provisioner:

            "delivery": {
                "disaster_recovery": {
                    "enable": true
                },
                ...
            }

    * If you are using the ssh provisioner:

            "delivery": {
                "disaster_recovery": {
                    "enable": true,
                    "ip": "10.194.8.8"
                },
                ...
            }

This needs to be done after creating the environment (`rake setup:generate_env`) but **before** converging the cluster (`rake setup:cluster`).

The `fqdn` parameter is also required in the `delivery` JSON hash when building Delivery in a DR configuration.

Accept License
-----------------
In order to accept the Chef Software License Agreement (https://www.chef.io/online-master-agreement/) you have to set the
attribute `default['delivery-cluster']['accept_license']` to `true`. Modify your environment file as follow:
```
{
  "name": "Accept Chef License Example",
  "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
  "chef_type": "environment",
  "override_attributes": {
    "delivery-cluster": {
      "accept_license": true,
      ...
      < all your other attributes goes here >
      ...
    }
  }
}
```


Available Provisioning Methods
------------
This cookbook uses [chef-provisioning](https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning) to manipulate the infrastructure acting as the orchestrator, it uses the default driver `vagrant` but you can switch drivers by modifying the attribute `['delivery-cluster']['driver']`

The available drivers that you can use are:

### Vagrant Driver [Default]
This driver will provision the Delivery cluster locally using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
As such, you MUST have vagrant installed for this to function.

The `rake setup:generate_env` task will generate this for you.

If you edit this config by hand, you MUST provide:

1. `vm_memory` and `vm_cpus`.
2. `vm_box`.
3. `network` configuration.

Here is an example of the environment file using the vagrant driver.
```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "description": "Delivery Cluster Environment",
  "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
  "chef_type": "environment",
  "override_attributes": {
    "delivery-cluster": {
      "id": "test",
      "driver": "vagrant",
      "vagrant": {
        "ssh_username": "vagrant",
        "key_file": "/Users/username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key",
        "vm_box": "opscode-centos-6.6",
        "image_url": "https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_centos-6.6_chef-provisionerless.box",
        "use_private_ip_for_ssh": true
      },
      "chef-server": {
        "organization": "test",
        "existing": false,
        "vm_hostname": "chef.example.com",
        "network": ":private_network, {ip: '33.33.33.10'}",
        "vm_memory": "2048",
        "vm_cpus": "2"
      },
      "delivery": {
        "version": "latest",
        "enterprise": "test",
        "license_file": "/Users/username/delivery.license",
        "vm_hostname": "delivery.example.com",
        "network": ":private_network, {ip: '33.33.33.11'}",
        "vm_memory": "2048",
        "vm_cpus": "2"
      },
      "supermarket": {
        "vm_hostname": "supermarket.example.com",
        "network": ":private_network, {ip: '33.33.33.13'}",

          "vm_memory": "2048",
          "vm_cpus": "2"
        },
        "delivery-cli": {
          "artifact": "https://delivery-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/cli/delivery-cli-20150408004719-1.x86_64.rpm",
          "checksum": "fa1f1724482182a9461c21a692b88ecc97e016b8307bd28834c2828eca702e6c"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### AWS Driver
This driver will provision the infrastructure in Amazon Ec2.

You MUST configure your `~/.aws/config` file like this:
```
$ vi ~/.aws/config
[default]
region = us-west-2
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```
You also need to create a `security_group` with the following ports open

        "count": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### SSH Driver
This driver will NOT provision any infrastrucute. It assumes you have already provisioned the machines and it will manipulate then to install and configure the Delivery Cluster.

You have to provide:

1. Ip address or Hostname for all your machine resources.
2. Username
3. Either `key_file` or `password`

The list of attributes that you have available are:

| Attribute                | Description                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ssh_username`           | SSH username to use to connect to machines. |
| `chef_config`            | Anything you want dumped in `/etc/chef/client.rb` |
| `chef_version`           | The chef version to install on the machine. |
| `key_file`               | The SSH Key to use to connect to the machines.   |
| `password`               | The password to use to connect to the machines.  |
| `prefix`                 | Prefix to add at the bigining of any ssh-command.|
| `bootstrap_proxy`        | Automatically configure HTTPS proxy. |
| `install_sh_path`        | Installation path of the shell script to install chef.|
| `use_private_ip_for_ssh` | Set to `true` if you want to use the private  ipaddress. |

This is an example of how to specify this information
```json
{
"name": "ssh-example",
  "description": "",
  "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
  "chef_type": "environment",
  "override_attributes": {
    "delivery-cluster": {
      "id": "ssh-example",
      "driver": "ssh",
      "ssh": {
        "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
        "prefix": "echo myPassword | sudo -S ",
        "key_file": "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem",
        "bootstrap_proxy": "MY_PROXY_URL",
        "chef_config": "http_proxy 'MY_PROXY_URL'\nno_proxy 'localhost'"
      },
      "chef-server": {
        "ip": "33.33.33.10",
        "organization": "ssh-example",
        "delivery_password": "SuperSecurePassword"
      },
      "delivery": {
        "ip": "33.33.33.11",
        "enterprise": "ssh-example",
        "version": "latest",
        "license_file": "/home/user/delivery.license"
      },
      "analytics": {
        "ip": "33.33.33.12"
      },
      "splunk": {
        "password": "demo",
        "ip": "33.33.33.13"
      },
      "supermarket": {
        "ip": "33.33.33.17"
      },
      "builders": {
        "count": 3,
        "1": { "ip": "33.33.33.14" },
        "2": { "ip": "33.33.33.15" },
        "3": { "ip": "33.33.33.16" }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Global Attributes
------------

### common_cluster_recipes

Add any recipe that you need to add to the run_list of all the servers
of the delivery-cluster.

As an example:
* We would like to aply a security policy to every single server on the cluster.

  `security_policies::lock_root_login` locks down root login

This attribute would look like:

```
default['delivery-cluster']['common_cluster_recipes'] = ['security_policies::lock_root_login']
```

### trusted_certs

Add the list of trusted certificates you depend on. These certificates will get added
to the list of trusted_certs within `chefdk`.

Copy your custom certificates to the `.chef/trusted_certs` directory and then list them as follows:

```
default['delivery-cluster']['trusted_certs'] = {
  'Proxy Cert': 'my_proxy.cer',
  'Corp Cert': 'corporate.crt',
  'Open Cert': 'other_open.crt'
}
```

Passing raw attributes to Components
------------
Every single component in the cluster has the ability to pass raw attributes, this is very
useful for example to manipulate the behavior of the cookbooks that the mechines will have in
their run_list. Having said that, you will have available a special attribute per component
`node['delivery-cluster'][COMPONENT_NAME]['attributes']` that you can inject any raw attribute
that will be transfer directly to the machine.

Some examples;

* If we have to deny `runit` cookbook to configure a package cloud repo on the build-nodes
we have to pass the following attribute:

  ```ruby
  node['delivery-cluster']['builders']['attributes'] = { 'runit' => { 'prefer_local_yum' => true } }
  ```

* To add custom settings to the chef-server configuration (`chef-server.rb`) you can pass them as the following example:

  ```ruby
  node['delivery-cluster']['chef-server']['attributes'] = { 'chef-server-12' => { 'extra_config' => 'notification_email "info@example.com"' } }
  ```
* Finally, lets imagine you added a special cookbook called `corp-iptables` to create/configure iptables rules
inside the chef-server, then you want to manipulate it to add some extra rules from this cookbook, then you will
pass the attributes like this:

  ```ruby
  node['delivery-cluster']['chef-server']['attributes'] = { 'corp-iptables' => { 'rules' => 'LIST_OF_RULES' } }
 ```

Specific Attributes per Component
------------

There are aditional specific attributes per component that you can use to configure your cluster
