# Delivery Upgrade
The following steps describes the process to upgrade delivery using `delivery-cluster`

1. Login to the provisioning node that manage the delivery infrastructure.
2. Swtich to the `delivery-cluster` repository.
  ```
  # cd ~/repo/delivery-cluster
  ```

3. Pull the latest code from github.
  ```
  # git fetch origin master
  # git pull origin master
  ```

4. Set your delivery environment.
  ```
  # export CHEF_ENV=my_environment_name
  ```

5. Upgrade delivery.
  ```
  # chef exec rake maintenance:upgrade
  ```

6. Validate the version of delivery by accessing this URL:
  ```
  https://my-delivery.com/status/version
  ```

**If the version of Delivery is pinned in the environment file, this upgrade will have no effect.**

An example of a pinned environment for version `0.3.67` of delivery
```json
  "delivery": {
    "version": "0.3.67",
  }
```

For upgrades set the version to `latest` as follow
```json
  "delivery": {
    "version": "latest",
  }
```

*We highly recommend customers build two different environment files and clusters, one with pinned version of delivery and one with `latest`, in order to test upgrades.*
